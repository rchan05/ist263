                    agencies and critical infrastructure have become increasingly common. These disruptions expose

                    August was marked by large-scale data breaches that exposed millions of personal records, sending shockwaves across the tech and financial sectors. Hackers infiltrated systems of major corporations, extracting sensitive information such as bank account details, Social Security numbers, and even healthcare records. For many, the fallout included financial fraud, identity theft, and a profound erosion of trust in digital platforms. These breaches serve as stark reminders of the ever-present risks in the digital age, emphasizing the need for advanced cybersecurity measures to protect individuals and organizations alike.

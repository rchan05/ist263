            <h2>Cyberattacks of the Month</h2>
            <p>In August, organizations around the globe faced unprecedented attacks. One of the most significant incidents occurred at **Hospital TechNet**, a leading healthcare network in Europe, where ransomware crippled their systems, forcing doctors to revert to manual record-keeping and delaying critical patient treatments. In a similar vein, a major financial firm in the U.S., **Greenstone Finance**, reported a breach that exposed the personal data of over 2.5 million clients, including sensitive banking information. For Emily Carter, a small business owner whose accounts were tied to Greenstone, this breach led to unauthorized withdrawals that left her scrambling to cover payroll for her employees. These incidents highlight the devastating ripple effects of cyberattacks, not only on organizations but also on the lives of individuals who depend on their services.</p>            <figure>

            <h2>Cyberterrorism Highlight</h2>
            <p>Cyberterrorism continues to threaten national security, with devastating real-world consequences. In July, the city of **Rivertown**, a small but vital logistics hub in the Midwest, fell victim to a ransomware attack on its municipal systems. Hackers encrypted critical infrastructure controls, including water treatment facilities and traffic management systems, demanding millions in cryptocurrency to restore operations. For Sarah Lopez, a single mother who relies on Rivertown’s public transit system, the halted services meant missing work shifts and scrambling for childcare. Similarly, in a separate attack, a coastal power grid in **Eastern Europe** was targeted, leaving thousands of homes without electricity for days during a record-breaking heatwave. These incidents illustrate the far-reaching impact of cyberterrorism—not just on governments and corporations but on the everyday lives of ordinary citizens.</p>            <figure>

            <h2>Data Breaches</h2>
            <p>Data breaches in August compromised millions of personal records, leaving individuals and organizations scrambling to recover. One notable breach involved **TechNova Systems**, a global software provider, where hackers accessed the sensitive data of over 10 million users, including email addresses, passwords, and payment details. For Michael Tran, a freelance graphic designer, the breach resulted in unauthorized charges to his business account, forcing him to cancel projects while sorting out the financial mess. Similarly, **Summit Financial**, a leading investment firm, suffered a breach exposing Social Security numbers and banking information of thousands of clients. Retiree **Barbara Jenkins**, who relied on Summit for her pension investments, spent weeks locked in frustration as she worked to secure her accounts and safeguard her savings. These incidents underscore how data breaches not only disrupt corporate operations but also deeply impact the lives of ordinary people who depend on these services.</p>            <figure>
